# xAPI-voider
From time to time there may be xAPI statements that should not be in the LRS. Since xAPI statements can not be deleted they must be VOIDED. By using the Voided verb along with the Statement Ref will send a Voided statment to the LRS effectively voiding out the statement you no longer want. 

## How to use
To use the app clone or download then open the "voidstatement" folder and run story.html in a browser.  
Fill in the blanks.



Only use this app in an emergency.
